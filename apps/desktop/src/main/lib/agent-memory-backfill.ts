/**
 * One-time backfill of the per-agent memory scaffold (docs/memory.md).
 *
 * Agents created while ADE_MEMORY_SCAFFOLD was OFF have a repo + an empty
 * memory/ dir but no canonical files or bridges. Now that the scaffold is
 * enabled by default we bring those agents up to spec at app launch.
 *
 * Conservative + idempotent by construction:
 * - Only touches ADE agents (workspaces.runtime set) whose repo is already set
 *   up (worktree/.git exists). A still-initializing or failed agent is left to
 *   its own init job.
 * - Skips any agent whose memory/ dir already holds a non-empty *.md file, so a
 *   scaffolded (or hand-authored) memory is never re-processed.
 * - Delegates to scaffoldAgentMemory, which is write-if-empty: even if it runs,
 *   it never overwrites a non-empty canonical file or an existing bridge.
 * - Per-agent try/catch so one bad agent never blocks the others or app launch.
